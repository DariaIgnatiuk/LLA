1. You both did a great job on this Hebrew learning app!

2. It’s great that you comment on every step in your code. This really helps people like me, who need to read your code from scratch, understand it better and faster.

3. As I alreaddy mentioned, you did a good job managing your time and tasks. It’s great to see that, because by the end, you have a solid foundation to present, and even before hearing from you, we can see the potential of the project and where it can go in the future.

4. One point I’d like to raise is that your code has several functions that are quite similar. In the future, try to find a way to combine them. This will improve your code and make it cleaner.

5. In conclusion, your code looks great — it’s clean and readable, which is a big plus for a developer!
